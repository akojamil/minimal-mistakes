## EXO-200
The [Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO)](https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/) is an experiment searching for the neutrino-less double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ of ${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$. It's a hypothetical decay that can only occur if neutrinos are Majorana fermions, i.e. if the neutrinos are their own anti-particles. The detector technology is a (LXe) time projection chamber (TPC) filled with ~150kg of liquid xenon. 
While current experimental limits have excluded the existence of $0\nu\beta\beta$ with half-lifes shorter than $\sim 10^{26}$ years, the next generation experiment at the tonne scale is already being planned ... 

## nEXO 
[nEXO](https://nexo.llnl.gov) aims to improve upon current generation experiment by improving by about two orders of magnitude, reaching a half-life sensitivity of $\sim 10^{28}$ years.
