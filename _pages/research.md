    excerpt: 'The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) is an experiment searching for the neutrino-less double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ of the isotope ${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$. It is a hypothetical decay that can only occur if neutrinos are Majorana fermions, which means that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. The detector technology used is a time projection chamber (TPC) filled with around 150kg of liquid xenon.'

    excerpt: 'The goal of nEXO is to improve by at least two orders of magnitude in half-life sensitivity upon current generation experiment, reaching a half-life sensitivity of $\geq 10^{28}$ years.'
