I am currently a Robert H. Dicke Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University and I work with [Prof. Cristiano Galbiati](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/cristiano-galbiati) on the upcoming [DarkSide-20k](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/darkside) experiment, searching for WIMP dark matter with a multi-tonne Liquid Argon target.

Previously, I was working as a PhD student at Wright Lab at Yale University working with [Prof. David Moore](https://campuspress.yale.edu/moorelab/) on the [EXO-200](https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/) and [nEXO](https://nexo.llnl.gov) experiments, searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ of  ${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$.
