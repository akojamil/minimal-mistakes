I am a 4th year graduate student in Physics at Yale University working with [Prof. David Moore](https://campuspress.yale.edu/moorelab/) on the [EXO-200](https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/) and [nEXO](https://nexo.llnl.gov) experiments, searching for the Neutrino-less Double Beta Decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ of  ${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$.
